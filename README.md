# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview of the Analysis:
Built a web app that will scrape through different URLs to locate and store the desired Mars information. Added images of Mars’s hemispheres online to the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. Used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images. The scraped data was stored on a Mongo database. The web application displays the data and the web app design was altered to accommodate these images as thumbnails. 
## Resources:
- Software: Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Visual Studio Code 1.54, Flask, MongoDB, BeautifulSoup, Splinter
